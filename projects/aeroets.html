		<h2>AEROETS</h2>
		<p>
			is a website that aims to promote engineering for aerospace at the <a target="blank" href="http://www.etsmtl.ca">École de technlogie supérieure</a>. During my studies there, I used to work part time for AEROETS. My primary task was to maintain the current website. Every week, I had a lot of spare time so I decided to give the old website a facelift and this is how this project was born.
		</p>
		<p>
			I built this website using mainly Twitter's Bootstrap (2.3) CSS framework and custom stylecheets when needed. The previous website structure was written in PHP and used a MySQL database. Originally, the PHP code for the page's structure was very hard to maintain and there were connections to the database everywhere, so I decided to reworte it from scratch.
		</p>
		<h3>Content Management</h3>
		<p>
			Like I said, my main task after the construction of the new website was still to maintain it. In other words, I stil had to manually add news, images and events. Again, my desire to optimize things emerged and I decided to add some content management features. At first, I thought about using existing solutions like Wordpress, but wasn't content with the overhead it would add to the website. In the end, I wrote a custom module in PHP that allow admins to add news and events on the website from a simple form.

		<h3>Security</h3>
		<p>
			The administration part being exposed on the web, and the database of AEROETS being hosted on the school servers, I thought to myself that I had to make a secure login for the new service. After some time looking for best practices, I found a neat tutorial on <a target="blank" href="http://www.wikihow.com/Create-a-Secure-Login-Script-in-PHP-and-MySQL">WikiHow</a> on which I based the majority of the security features I implemented. Notably, the added features cover (to some extent) :

		<ul>
			<li>SQL Injections</li>
			<li>Session Hijacking</li>
			<li>Network Eavesdropping</li>
			<li>Cross Site Scripting</li>
			<li>Brute Force Attacks</li>
		</ul>
