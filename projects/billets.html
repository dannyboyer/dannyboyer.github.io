		<h2>BillETS</h2>
		<p>
			is a simple online platform for selling tickets for various shows. It is mostly written in the Java Enterprise Environment and is a school projet. The main goal of the exercise was to design and implement a system that could handle a significant amount of requests in a short period.
		</p>
		<p>
			For a smoother implementation, the project was divided into 4 stages.
		</p>
		<h3>Static prototype</h3>
		<p>
			The first step was to built a static, plain HTML website as a proof of concept. Technicaly, there is not much to say about this, except that we used Twitter's Bootsrap CSS framework and a minimalist approach for the design. Takee a look at it <a target="blank" href="http://dannyboyer.ca/BillETS/">here </a>. Please, keep in mind that this is just a "static" version of the full website. If you are interested in trying the full featured version, you can check the <a target="blank" href="https://github.com/dannyboyer/BillETS">source code</a> on github.
		</p>

		<h3>JEE integration</h3>
		<p>
			After all the pages were ready, the JEE integration was done. The static pages where converted in ".JSP" format and the routing of the application was done using the Spring MVC framework, following the REST principles. Instead of leaving the shows pages statically populated, an XML stub strategy was used. That way, it was easier to edit or add new shows to BillETS.
		</p>
		<h3>Business logic</h3>
		<p>
			The basics of the application being completed, the addition of the business logic requirements was done. Basically, it consisted of the sessions management and the state of the reserved tickets to prevents users from buying another's ticket.
		</p>
		<h3>Adding persistance</h3>
		<p>
			Currently, BillETS still use XML stubs for it's collection of shows, but not for long. Soon, a persistance layer will be add to keep track of all the transactions, shopping carts and sessions. More details to come!
