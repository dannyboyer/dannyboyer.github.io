	<h2>BillETS</h2>
	<p>
		is a simple online platform for selling tickets for various shows. It is mostly written in the Java Enterprise Environment and is a school project. The main goal of the exercise was to design and implement a system that could handle a significant amount of requests in a short period of time.
	</p>

	<h3>Static prototype</h3>
	<p>
		The first step was to build a static, plain HTML website as a proof of concept. Technically, there is not much to say about this, except that we used Twitter's Bootsrap CSS framework and a minimalist approach for the design. Take a look at it <a target="blank" href="http://dannyboyer.ca/BillETS/">here </a>. Please, keep in mind that this is just a "static" version of the full website. If you are interested in trying the full featured version, you can check the <a target="blank" href="https://github.com/dannyboyer/BillETS">source code</a> on github.
	</p>

	<h3>JEE integration</h3>
	<p>
		After all the pages were ready, the JEE integration was done. The static pages were converted in ".JSP" format and the routing of the application was done using the Spring MVC framework, following the REST principles. Instead of leaving the show pages statically populated, an XML stub strategy was used. That way, it was easier to edit or add new shows to BillETS before the addition of a database.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Adding persistence</h3>
	<p>
		The final and most important part of this project was to add a layer of persistence for all the data of the shows and the ticket sales. This was done by replacing the xml stub by a PostgreSQL Database. In order to simplify the interaction between the information in the database and their object counterparts, we used Hibernate to do the mapping automatically.
