###Hello!


My name is **Danny Boyer** and I am currently studying information technology engineering at École de technologie supérieure in Montreal, Quebec.

Most of my work experience come from the field of web development. Notably, I've had the chance to work on neat things at places like [Nexalogy](http://nexalogy.com/), [Canadian Space Agency](http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/default.asp) and [AEROETS](http://aeroets.etsmtl.ca/pages/en/home/).
